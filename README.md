**Time of Day** 
- The data is divided by the hour of the day, from 0 (midnight) to 23 (11 PM).
- Each point or line on the plot represents the number of transportation events happening at that particular hour.

**Transport Modes** 
- Different lines on the graph represent different modes of transportation.
- For example, one line might show how many bus trips occur at each hour, another line for metro services, and another for trains.

**Peak Hours**
- By looking at the graph, we can see which hours have the highest points on the lines.
- These are the peak hours when the most transport events are happening. E.g., if the line for buses has high points at 8AM and 6PM.
    - It suggests that these are busy times for bus transportation, likely because people are commuting to and from work.

**Visual Representation** 
- The graph makes it easy to compare between different transportation modes at a glance.
- For instance, if the train line peaks later in the morning than the bus line, it might suggest different usage patternsâ€”perhaps trains are more popular for mid-morning commutes.
- By analyzing such data, city planners, transport authorities, and even regular commuters can understand the transportation demand better throughout the day.
- This information can help in planning schedules, improving service availability during peak times, and even in reducing congestion by providing more options during busy hours.

**New York**
- Buses and metros have their peak usage around the same early morning hours, commuters prefer public transit to start their day.
- Trains in New York peak slightly later, indicating a possible preference for train travel for mid-morning commutes.

**Berlin** 
- Both metro and bus services show peak usage during what appears to be the late morning or midday.
- This could indicate a shift in commuting patterns or a preference for later starts to the day.
- Trains peak much earlier, suggesting that train commuters in Berlin start their day earlier than those using buses or metros.

**Tokyo** 
- There's a notable peak in the early evening for buses, which might indicate a preference for bus travel as people return home from work.
- Metro and train services peak in the late evening, possibly reflecting late working hours or recreational outings in the evening.

**Morning vs. Evening Rush** 
- In general, metros and buses in these cities tend to have peaks during what are traditionally considered rush hours (early morning and late evening).
- This pattern underscores the heavy reliance on public transport during typical workday commutes.

**Varied Commuting Times**
- The variation in peak hours across cities and modes suggests that commuting times can vary widely due to factors like work culture, city layout, and available transport options. 
- For example, if metros in Tokyo are busiest in the late evening, it could indicate a cultural tendency towards later work hours or evening activities.

**Resource Allocation**
- Transportation authorities could use this data to better allocate resources, such as adding more vehicles during peak times.
- Alternatively, increasing the frequency of services to accommodate higher passenger loads could be considered.

**Schedule Adjustments**
- Adjusting schedules to better match peak demand times can enhance efficiency and reduce congestion, improving overall passenger satisfaction.

**How does passenger satisfaction vary among different transport modes?**

- The bar plot indicates that metros receive the least average satisfaction rating among all transport modes.
- This suggests that an opportunity to enhance and improve metro services is required in order to improve passenger satisfaction and potentially increase ridership.

**Which cities have the highest route popularity and what could be the reasons?**

- The bar plot illustrates the average popularity of transportation routes across different cities, showing that some cities have significantly higher route popularity than others.
- This suggests that certain cities have particularly favored or efficient transportation systems, or possibly higher demands due to larger populations or more tourists.
- Understanding these trends can help us prioritize where to allocate resources for improvements or expansions in transportation services to enhance overall connectivity and satisfaction.

**How satisfied are the passengers across different cities?**
